Ran the following command in the package's root directory:

cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++11 --suppress=missingIncludeSystem src/* include/turtlebot3_walker/*

With the resulting output:

Checking include/turtlebot3_walker/WalkerController.hpp ...
1/3 files checked 36% done
Checking src/WalkerController.cpp ...
2/3 files checked 64% done
Checking src/WalkerNode.cpp ...
3/3 files checked 100% done
(information) Cppcheck cannot find all the include files (use --check-config for details)

The output shows that there are warnings that the tool cannot find a
header file, but its location follows a ROS/catkin package standard.
Choosing to keep this as is (the package builds according to the
instructions in the README).
